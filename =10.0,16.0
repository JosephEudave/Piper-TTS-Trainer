  - Downgrading numpy (2.2.5 -> 1.24.3)

PEP517 build of a dependency failed

Backend 'setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__' is not available.

Note: This error originates from the build backend, and is likely not a problem with poetry but one of the following issues with numpy (1.24.3)

  - not supporting PEP 517 builds
  - not specifying PEP 517 build requirements correctly
  - the build requirements are incompatible with your operating system or Python version
  - the build requirements are missing system dependencies (eg: compilers, libraries, headers).

You can verify this by running pip wheel --no-cache-dir --use-pep517 "numpy (==1.24.3)".
